### 5. Final Feedback

<hr>

<p>
To be honest, the app could have be more flushed out. I wouldn't be yourself up about it because you still did a really great job. I think the idea was just to ambitious, too soon, which made developing the MVP more difficult. I do recommend taking the time to flush out the additional features. Also you are missing a ton of deliverables for this project. None of the links worked in the Readme. Please let me know when when those are fixed so I can further update your feedback.
