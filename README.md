# Civic Duty

Civic Duty is a non-partisan web app that gamifies civic participation. Organizations can sign up to the app and register sub-organizations and users to take part in competitions that incentivize voter registration and civic participation. In this iteration of the app the competition is between sub-organizations to see who can get the best percentage of users to registered voters.

Users can see a leaderboard updates in real-time as users update their voter status.

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements

Participation in town hall meetings, community volunteering, and other civic activities can all be leveraged to create a holistic, good-natured, competition between businesses and organizations to encourage a culture of enthusiasm for community involvement.
