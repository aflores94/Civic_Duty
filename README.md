# Civic Duty

Civic Duty is a non-partisan web app that gamifies civic participation. Organizations can sign up to the app and register sub-organizations and users to take part in competitions that incentivize voter registration and civic participation. In this iteration of the app the user can sign up as a suborganization administrator and view all voters and their voter status. 

## Technologies Used:

* CSS3

### Instructions:
1) Sign up as a user, choose your organization
2) Create voters
3) Update their registered status as necessary 
4) See all of your voters on your home page
5) Enjoy!


## Next Steps and Future Enhancements 
The next iteration of the app will allow users to see a leaderboard with the percentages of all suborganizations within their organization. In that stage of the app the competition is between sub-organizations to see who can get the best percentage of users to registered voters.

Users can see a leaderboard updates in real-time as users update their voter status. 

The next iteration of the app will add interorganizational competition and leaderboards. Future iterations will also implement security features to verify affiliation with an organization on sign up. 

This app has a lot of capacity for scalability. Participation in town hall meetings, community volunteering, and other civic activities can all be leveraged to create a holistic, good-natured, competition between businesses and organizations to encourage a culture of enthusiasm for community involvement.
